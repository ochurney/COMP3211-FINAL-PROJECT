# COMP3211-FINAL-PROJECT


Intro---------------
This project is dedicated to examining different methods of solving the classic
 Pacman Atari game through the OpenAI environment.



Problem--------------
OpenAI provides an environment for simulating a simple Atari video game while
allowing you to provide the policies for the agent, essentially allowing you
to implement your own strategy for solving the game. For each game, there are two
variations on different types of input: either using memory RAM as input, or using
screenshots of the game as input. In order to make the problem more interesting and
add elements of AI dealing with computer vision, we have chosen the latter form of input.




Solution--------------

Random:
One way of trying to solve the problem was by randomly controlling the pacman agent. This
is a somewhat poor approach to an actual solution, but it gives a good baseline for comparing
our other solutions.


Reinforced Learning:



Constraint Satisfaction (AC3 Algorithm):
	Another attempt to solve the problem involved framing the game as a constraint satisfaction problem.
For this type of problem, we have to deal with a set of variables, a set of domains, and a set of 
constraints. We then try to find evalutaions of the variables within those domains that satisfy our 
constraints.





Process---------------
	We tested out two different algorithms.
